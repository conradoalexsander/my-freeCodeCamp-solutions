# My freeCodeCamp Solutions

Hello there!

This repository has some of mine freeCodeCamp exercises and challenges solutions. Check it out and feel free to reach me if
you have any questions, I will be glad if I can help.

PS.: Since the downloaded version of freeCodeCamp solutions are JSON, I wrote a small tutorial on how to make it easier to understand
directly in your browser, it is located in javascript folder.
